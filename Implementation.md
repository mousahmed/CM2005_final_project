# OtoDecks DJ Application Implementation Plan

## Analysis of `combined.cpp`

### Features Already Implemented
1. **Basic DJ Features**:
   - Loading, playing, and mixing tracks using `DJAudioPlayer`.
   - GUI components for deck control (`DeckGUI`).
   - Waveform display (`WaveformDisplay`).

2. **Custom Deck Control Component**:
   - `DeckGUI` class with buttons and sliders for play, stop, load, volume, speed, and position control.

3. **Music Library Component**:
   - `PlaylistComponent` class with a table to display track titles.
   - Basic functionality for adding and displaying tracks.

### Missing or Incomplete Sections
1. **GUI Customization**:
   - Color changes and event listeners for enhanced user interaction.

2. **New DJ Feature**:
   - Additional functionality such as beat matching, sound effects, or auto-fade.

3. **Final Testing & Debugging**:
   - Comprehensive testing to handle edge cases and ensure robustness.

## Updated Completion Plan

### Remaining Tasks
1. **GUI Customization**:
   - Implement color changes for buttons and sliders.
   - Add event listeners for enhanced user interaction.

2. **New DJ Feature**:
   - Identify and implement a new feature (e.g., beat matching, sound effects, or auto-fade).

3. **Final Testing & Debugging**:
   - Conduct thorough testing of all components.
   - Debug and fix any issues found during testing.

### Step-by-Step Tasks

#### 1. GUI Customization
- **Task 1.1**: Customize button colors.
  - Change the color of play, stop, and load buttons based on their state (e.g., hover, click).
- **Task 1.2**: Customize slider colors.
  - Change the color of volume, speed, and position sliders.
- **Task 1.3**: Add event listeners.
  - Implement event listeners for enhanced user interaction (e.g., tooltips, animations).

#### 2. New DJ Feature
- **Task 2.1**: Identify the new feature.
  - Decide on the new feature to be implemented (e.g., beat matching, sound effects, or auto-fade).
- **Task 2.2**: Design the feature.
  - Plan the implementation details for the new feature.
- **Task 2.3**: Implement the feature.
  - Write the code to add the new feature to the application.
- **Task 2.4**: Integrate the feature.
  - Ensure the new feature works seamlessly with existing components.

#### 3. Final Testing & Debugging
- **Task 3.1**: Conduct unit testing.
  - Write and run unit tests for all components.
- **Task 3.2**: Conduct integration testing.
  - Test the interaction between different components.
- **Task 3.3**: Debug and fix issues.
  - Identify and fix any bugs or issues found during testing.
- **Task 3.4**: Conduct user testing.
  - Get feedback from users and make necessary improvements.

## Dependencies and Priorities
- **Priority 1**: Complete GUI customization to enhance user experience.
- **Priority 2**: Implement the new DJ feature to add value to the application.
- **Priority 3**: Conduct final testing and debugging to ensure the application is robust and reliable.

## Final Deliverables
1. **Updated implementation plan based on `combined.cpp` analysis**.
2. **Step-by-step breakdown of remaining work**.
3. **Identification of dependencies and priorities**.
